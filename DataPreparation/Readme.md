# Data Preparation and Raw Inputs

This folder contains **raw data**, **geospatial shapes**, and **scripts** used to prepare the datasets for further analysis.

---

## Data Preparation

After running each cell of the file **`1_DataPreparation.RMD`**,  
the data will be **fully prepared** and **all major datasets** will be **loaded and ready for analysis**.

---

## Optional Script

The script **`2_Collect_from_google.R`** **does not need to be executed**.  
It is included **for the sake of completeness**, as we provide the corresponding **pre-extracted data** in the **`DataBackup`** folder.
